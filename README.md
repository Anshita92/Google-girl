## Problem Statement
In the era of escalating healthcare challenges, there is an urgent need to harness the power of AI technologies to revolutionize the medical landscape. By developing an advanced recommender system that incorporates electronic health records (EHRs), we can analyze user symptoms with unparalleled accuracy, predict potential diseases, and provide personalized precautions to ensure users' well-being. This innovative approach empowers users to take control of their health management, fostering a deeper understanding of their health and contributing to an improved quality of life. 
The objective is to create an AI-driven recommender system that addresses the critical aspects of healthcare delivery. The application should be able to analyze user symptoms, predict potential diseases, recommend appropriate precautions, and connect users with certified healthcare professionals. By integrating medical histories, user ratings, preferences, affordability, and EHRs, the system ensures personalized, accessible, and high-quality medical services, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more informed society.
